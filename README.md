Hi! I'm Bruno. Nice to meet you! This is my portfolio. I hope you like it

## About me

Born in Brazil, I started working as a Full Stack developer, focused on Front End, in 2018.

In my carrier, I’ve done work both on-site and remotely for national and international companies creating products for areas ranging from factories to educational applications. I’m an easygoing, curious, and hardworking person. I’m always trying to learn something new about technology and improve my soft and hard skills.

For me, coding something from scratch and being able to see the finished product on the browser screen brings me joy.

## About the project

This SPA was developed using Next.JS as the framework (with Typescript) and TailwindCSS as the styling library.

All the content is managed using Sanity CMS.

The deployed application is completely managed by Vercel and it is rebuilt with every commit in a CI/CD strategy.
